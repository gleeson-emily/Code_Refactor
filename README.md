## Horiseon Website - Code Refactor Project

A project for our coding/full stack development bootcamp.

This is a code refactor. I modified the CSS file provided to me by consolidating repeated code into the same class or id - please see the comments in my CSS file for more details. I also added semantic elements to the html file, gave the website a descriptive title, and added alt text to the images for improved accessibility.
